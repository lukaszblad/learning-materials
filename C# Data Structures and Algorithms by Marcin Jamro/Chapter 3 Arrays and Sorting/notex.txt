Arrays
    the number of items in an array cannot be changed after initialization

    Single dimensional arrays
        declaration: int[] myNumbers;
        initialization: myNumbers = new int[5];
        indexing: int myNumber = myNumbers[2];

    Multi dimensional arrays
        declaration: int[,] myMatrix = new int[5,3];
        initialization: int[,] myMatrix = new int[,]
                        {
                            {1, 2, 3},
                            {3, 2, 1},
                            {2, 3, 1}
                        }
        indexing: myMatrixValue = myMatrix[1, 2];
    
    Jagged arrays
        single dimensional array, where each element is another array
        declaration: int[][] myNumbers = new int[4][];
        initialization: myNumbers[0] = [9, 5];
                        myNumbers[1] = [0, -3, 12];
                        myNumbers[3] = [54]
        indexing: myNumbers[1][2];

Sorting algorithms

    Selection sort
        divides the array in two parts: sorted and unsorted. The algorithm finds
        the smallest element in the unsorted part and exchanges it with the first
        element in the sorted part.
