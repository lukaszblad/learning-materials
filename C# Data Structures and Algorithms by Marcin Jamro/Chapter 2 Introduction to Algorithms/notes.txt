Algorithm definition
    a well-defined solution for solving a particular problem or performing a computation
    an algorithm should containt a finite sequences of unambiguous instructions,
    which provides you with an effective and efficient way of solving the problem.

Recursive algorithms
    an algorithm is recursive if it calls itself to solve smaller subproblems
    of the original problem

Divide and conquer algorithms
    solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, calling them
    recursively until ther are simple enough to be solved directly

Back-tracking algorithms
    based on backtracking to previous nodes when the current path is a dead end

Greedy algorithms
    choosing the best option at each step, not concerned about the overall solution

Heuristic algorithms
    a heuristic algorithm calculates a near-optimal solution for an optimization
    problem and is especially useful for scenarions when the exact methods are not 
    available or are too slow (significatn speed boost, but decreased accuracy)

Dynamic programming
    a technique that optimized recursive algorithms by limiting the necessity
    of computing the same result multiple times

Brute-force algorithms
    checking all possible options and choosing the best one
